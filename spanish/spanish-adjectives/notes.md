This is only the MM.adj.csv thing. There are other adjectives in tanc/adjectives.csv, which are possessive adjectives (eg. Mine, yours, theirs).

Most of the non-matched adjectives are verb participes, such as 'abandoned'.
On the other hand, there were no ordinal (first, second, third) adjectives in the bilingual dictionary.
