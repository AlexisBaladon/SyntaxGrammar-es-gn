First we scraped the RAE for transitivity or intransitivity of each verb. We also considered taking them from Freeling, by analyzing a corpus and deriving their occurrences from there, but instead went first for the RAE as it was easier and quicker, and then went for the Ancora verb lexicon which includes a lot of useful information for many (though not all) of our verbs, including ditransitive verbs unlike the RAE. Hence we used Ancora for most verbs and RAE for the remainder.
